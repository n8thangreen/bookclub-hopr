# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the Hands-on Programming with R book club! 

This website is a companion for the book [_Hands-on Programming with R_](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) by Garrett Grolemund.

This companion follows the [Data Science Learning Community Code of Conduct](https://dslc.io/code_of_conduct.html).

## Book club meetings {-}

- Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book (or part of a chapter).
  - **This is the best way to learn the material!**
- Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter.
- More information about how to present is available in the [github repo](https://github.com/n8thangreen/bookclub-hopr).
- Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the [where?]().

## Pace {-}

- We'll _try_ to cover 1 chapter/week, but...
- ...It's ok to split chapters when they feel like too much.
- We will try to meet every week, but will likely take some breaks for holidays, etc.
